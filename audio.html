<p>The modern digital synthesizer is a triumph of electrical and computer engineering. It can extremely accurately reproduce the sound of almost any instrument in real time, and it can produce otherworldly sounds that have never been heard. From some of the most iconic music to artificial speech synthesis, digital sound is a technology that pervades our lives. </p>

  <p><b>About the course:</b> In this course, we teach you a variety of sound synthesis methods, from old school subtractive synthesis to modern physical modeling. You learn to build effects such as reverb and surround-sound from scratch. The emphasis is on implementing extremely efficient, real time audio processing algorithms in C++ and controlling sound generation using the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) standard. In addition to weekly sound synthesis challenges, we will have a variety of guest speakers from companies like Dolby and Microsoft. </p>

  <p><b>Preparation:</b> Student should have had a basic introduction to programming (CSE 142/143) and a basic signal processing course (EE 242).</p>

  <p><b>Instructor:</b> The course will be taught by ECE Prof. Eric Klavins, who holds dual degrees in CSE and Music. Has been developing real time systems in C++ for a variety of applications for decades. His research spans from robotics to genetics, and he has taught courses in software engineering, robotics, control systems, and engineering mathematics. </p>
