<p> Eric Klavins is a professor of electrical engineering
  at the University of Washington in Seattle. He received a B.M. in
  Music in 1992 and a B.S. in computer science in 1996 from San
  Francisco State University. He received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees
  in computer science and engineering in 1999 and 2001 from the
  University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. From 2001 to 2003 he was a
  postdoctoral scholar in the Control and Dynamical Systems Department
  at the California Institute of Technology where he worked with
  Richard Murray. In 2003 Eric was hired in Electrical Engineering at
  the University of Washington in Seattle, WA and received tenure
  in 2009. He holds adjunct appointments in Computer Science and
  Engineering and in Bioengineering and is the Director for the UW
  Center for Synthetic Biology.</p>

<p>Until approximately 2008, Klavins' research was primarily in
  computer science and control systems, focusing on stochastic
  processes, robotics and self-assembly. At about this time, he
  learned the basics of genetic engineering of the next few years
  switched entirely fields to synthetic biology and now runs an
  interdisplinary group of engineers, biologists, experimentalists,
  and theorists -- all focused on engineering life. His current
  projects include synthetic multicellular systems with engineered
  bacteria and yeast, modeling and design for synthetic multicellular
  systems, and laboratory automation.</p>
